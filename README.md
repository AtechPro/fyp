# Centralized Hub Home Automation

In the rapid envolving landscape of the digital technology, the IoT show transformative potential for other sector in Malaysia. however with that growignn of IoT, there is not all people aware of IoT existence or practical application. Implementation on IoT based technology can be seen in the Malaysia where the start to introduce The Smart City Framework Malaysia (MSCF) as the step for Implementing IoT which give motivation me try to understand or try how IoT works. Malaysians, espically in sabah have the choices to become the early adopter for IoT implementation but the choice of trying IoT is limited. Because of the choice limitation, IoT likely vendor locked, scattered, and pricey to own one. Even finding a good IoT product is only available at the Peninsular Malaysia. The Project stockholder is mainly for the hobbyist , IoT store, Internet Service Provider and IT store so that they can implement IoT on their own home. This Project aim to develop a low cost, lightweight IoT infrastructure which operates using MQTT as the communication Protocol. after designing the project, its will need to develop a centralized system for communication between IoT devices using Raspberry Pi as the Server and ESP as the IoT client. After Develop the system, the project need to evaluate the general functionality of the IoT system by doing usability testing and black box such as automation and remote functions

ps : idk what i wrote but that the introduction

## Usage

Local usage, local network, closed network = more secure right (can't avoid tailgating tbh), the main of this project is to fulfill the final year project. security is not my first initilization because of hard to implement or encrypt the data transfer

## system requirements
- 32 bit linux (any linux should be able to run), make sure the usb wifi is support with the linux version 
- raspberry pi 3 or 4 (any raspberry pi should be able to run)
- you can consider your old laptop, celeron should be able to run. pull out your old thinkpad, or 2007 ish laptop, i can't gurenteed the power consumptions. i suggest the laptop uses low then 45w. 
- ESP32 or ESP8266 (any ESP should be able to run)
- need more that 2 interface, such as wifi, ethernet (Recommended using the Ethernet)




## additional note

- Why I'm still here? just to suffer? 
- You are totally cooked when you are ran out of your time and not doing thing that productive
